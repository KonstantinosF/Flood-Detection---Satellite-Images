# Flood-Detection---Satellite Images
<b><em><i>MSc (Master of Science) in Data Science - NCSR "Demokritos" & UoP</i></em></b>

This is a Semester Project which aim is to employ a Deep Learning model in order to detect Flood Events from Satellite Images


Dataset's Name: SEN12-FLOOD : A SAR and Multispectral Dataset for Flood Detection </br>
This dataset is composed of co-registered optical and SAR images time series for the detection of flood events.
