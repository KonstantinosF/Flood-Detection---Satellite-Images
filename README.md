This is a Semester Project which aim is to employ a Deep Learning model in order to detect Flood Events from Satellite Images

<em><b><i>General Description</i></b></em>

Dataset's Name: SEN12-FLOOD : A SAR and Multispectral Dataset for Flood Detection </br>
This dataset is composed of co-registered optical and SAR images time series for the detection of flood events.

Time Period: December 2019 up to May 2019

Study Areas: African, Iranian, Australian cities


# Description of the Dataset 
## General 
The observed areas correspond to 337 locations (cities and their surroundings ) in West and SouthEast Africa, Middle-East, and Australia where a flood event occurred during the considered period. The period of acquisition goes from December 2018 to May 2019.
For each location, the following data are provided:

* Time series of Sentinel-2 multispectral images. These images are composed of 12 bands,
at 10m ground-sampling distance and are provided with Level 2A atmospheric correction.
* Time series of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. The images are provided
with radiometric calibration and range doppler terrain correction based on the SRTM digital
elevation model. For one acquisition, two raster images are available corresponding to the
polarimetry channels VV and VH.
* Time series of binary labels for each image / date: flood or no flood.
